Hello Everyone..

I Am Akash Kumar and At The Time of Uploading This Repository, I Am In 5th Semester Of Engineering.

I Am Learning Data Structures And Algorithms From Past 4 Months and In The Past 4 Months I Have Been implementing The Programs Of The Data Structures And Algorithms Which I Have Learnt...

In This Repository I Have Included All of Those Programs Which Includes Several Data Structures And Algorithms.


Data Structures Included In This Repository Are -
    
    1. Binary Search Trees
    2. Binary Trees
    3. Linked Lists
        -Single Linked List
        -Double Linked List
        -Circular Linked List
        -Doubly Circular Linked List
    
    4. Heap Data Structure
    5. Stack Data Structure
    6. Queue Data Structure
        -Queue
        -Circular Queue
        -Double Ended Queue
    
    7. Graph Data Structure

Algorithms Included In This Repository Are -

    1. Searching Algorithms
        -Linear Search
        -Binary Search

    2. Sorting Algorithms
        -Bubble Sort
        -Quick Sort
        -Merge Sort
        -Shell Sort
        -Min Heap Sort
        -Max Heap Sort
        -Bucket Sort / Radix Sort
        -Insertion Sort
        -Selection Sort


The Implementation of The Algorithms Is In Python Language.

But The Graph Data Structure Is Implemented In Java Language..


Please Don't Get Bother By The Name of The Classes and Functions Used In The Programs..

Also I Would Like To Mention That As I Am New To Data Structures and Algorithms So Some

Algorithms and Might Not Be Perfect..

So I Apologise For That..

The Implementation Of Algorithms Might Also Be Not Perfect So I Apologise For That Too..



Any Changes Or Updates Will be Appreciated..

Thank You !!
